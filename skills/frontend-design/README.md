# frontend-design

> Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Avoids generic AI aesthetics.

**Source:** Based on [Anthropic's official frontend-design plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/frontend-design).

## What it does

Guides creation of visually striking, production-grade frontend interfaces. Enforces a bold aesthetic direction and rejects generic "AI slop" patterns (Inter font, purple gradients on white, predictable layouts).

## Usage

```
/frontend-design    # then describe what you want to build
```

## What you get

- **Design thinking** phase before coding (purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation)
- **Working code** (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is production-grade
- **Distinctive aesthetics** — typography, color, motion, spatial composition, backgrounds
- **Performance-aware** — code-splitting, data fetching without waterfalls, bundle-conscious choices

## Design principles

- Choose an extreme aesthetic direction and execute with precision
- Typography: distinctive, characterful font choices (never Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Color: dominant colors with sharp accents, not timid even palettes
- Motion: high-impact orchestrated reveals over scattered micro-interactions
- Layout: asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space
- Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision
